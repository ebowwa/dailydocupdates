# Test In The Demo Environment

> Set up and test with Kalshi's demo environment

For testing purposes, Kalshi offers a *demo* environment with mock funds. You can access the Demo environment at [https://demo.kalshi.co/](https://demo.kalshi.co/). For safety, credentials are not shared between this environment and production.

To set up a Kalshi Demo account, [follow this step-by-step tutorial](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRvhUAqRBYzJmt7JCinMXmu6KVWkj-cc7ikDXGConmqjcv4mnlJacgHPcZJ20fWWnrYdubn-oczclKP/pub?start=false\&loop=false\&delayms=3000\&slide=id.p).

Demo's API root is `https://demo-api.kalshi.co/trade-api/v2`.
