# Making Your First Request

> Start trading with Kalshi API in under 5 minutes

To make your request we recommend testing a public endpoint like [GetMarkets](https://docs.kalshi.com/api-reference/market/get-markets). As you explore our other endpoints, you'll notice some endpoints return an authentication\_error. If you want to experiment with these endpoints, you will need to get [API Keys](https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/api_keys). You may also want to sign up for a demo account to test without real funds.
