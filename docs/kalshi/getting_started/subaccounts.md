# Subaccounts

> Isolate balances and positions within a single Direct account

Subaccounts let a **Direct** account partition its balance and positions into
independent buckets under one set of API credentials. Every account has a
primary subaccount (number `0`) and may use numbered subaccounts `1`–`63`.

<Note>
  Subaccounts are currently an **API-only** feature — they are not yet supported in the
  Kalshi web or mobile app. Numbered-subaccount balances and positions are managed through
  the trade API.
</Note>

## Numbering

| Number   | Meaning                                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `0`      | Primary subaccount (the default account) |
| `1`–`63` | User-managed numbered subaccounts        |

## Transfers

You can move value between your own subaccounts. Transfers net to zero at the
account level — nothing leaves your account.

| Type     | Endpoint                                         | Moves                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Cash     | `POST /portfolio/subaccounts/transfer`           | Funds (in cents)        |
| Position | `POST /portfolio/subaccounts/positions/transfer` | An open market position |

Both are idempotent on a client-supplied `client_transfer_id`: retrying with the
same value returns `409` instead of applying the transfer twice.

### Position transfer pricing

`price_cents` sets the per-contract cost basis on each subaccount and the
realized P\&L on the source. For example, moving 100 YES contracts from
subaccount 0 to 1:

| `price_cents` | Source                           | Destination                             | Net |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --- |
| `40`          | closes 100 @ 40c (+\$40 cash)    | opens 100 @ 40c (-\$40 cash), basis 40c | \$0 |
| `60`          | closes 100 @ 60c, realizes +\$20 | opens 100 @ 60c, basis 60c              | \$0 |

The aggregate always nets to zero at the account level.

## Listing transfers

`GET /portfolio/subaccounts/transfers` returns both cash and position transfers,
paginated. Each row carries a `transfer_type` field (`cash` or `position`);
position rows additionally include `market_ticker`, `side`, `count`, and
`price_cents`.
