# Fee Rounding

> How the exchange rounds fees to maintain cent-aligned balances.

## Overview

User balances must be exact multiples of **\$0.01** before and after every fill. When a trade produces a sub-cent balance change, the exchange charges a **rounding fee** to bring the balance back to cent alignment. A **fee accumulator** applies rounding across all fills of an order collectively so that the total fee converges to what a single equivalent fill would cost.

Every fill produces three fee components:

| Component        | Description                                                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trade fee**    | Fee from the fee model, rounded up to the nearest \$0.0001 (centicent)     |
| **Rounding fee** | Sub-cent adjustment that restores cent-alignment (\$0.0000 - \$0.0099)     |
| **Rebate**       | Refund from accumulated rounding overpayment (always a multiple of \$0.01) |

**Net fee** = trade fee + rounding fee - rebate (always >= \$0.00)

## Rounding Mechanics

Given a fill's `revenue` (signed; negative for buyers) and `trade_fee`:

1. Round trade fee **up** to the nearest \$0.0001
2. Compute `balance_change = revenue - trade_fee`
3. Floor `balance_change` toward negative infinity to the nearest \$0.01
4. `rounding_fee = balance_change - floor(balance_change)`

The user's balance changes by `floor(balance_change)`, which is always cent-aligned.

## Fee Accumulator

The fee accumulator tracks cumulative rounding overpayment across all fills of an order. Once the accumulated rounding exceeds \$0.01, a whole-cent rebate is issued and the accumulator is reduced by \$0.01. This ensures the total fee across many small fills converges to what a single equivalent fill would cost.

<Note>
  The fee accumulator is maintained per order across all fills regardless of whether the fills are taker or maker. If an order initially takes (matching resting orders) and then becomes a resting maker order, the accumulated rounding carries over to subsequent maker fills.

## When Does Rounding Apply?

Rounding applies whenever `revenue - trade_fee` has a sub-cent component. This can happen two ways:

* **Subpenny prices** (e.g., \$0.0550) — sub-cent revenue from the price itself
* **Fractional contracts** (e.g., 0.30 contracts) — sub-cent revenue from the fractional quantity

When both apply simultaneously, intermediate values can reach up to 6 decimal places (for example, `$0.3301 * 0.03 = $0.009903`). The worked examples below show each scenario.

## Worked Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Subpenny prices: buy 3 contracts at $0.055 (three 1-lot matches)">
    Buy **3 contracts** at **\$0.055** — filled as three 1-lot matches. Contracts are whole; rounding arises from the sub-cent price.

    **Fill 1 walkthrough:**

    ```
    revenue        = -$0.055 x 1       = -$0.0550
    trade fee      = $0.0085             (ceiled to centicent)
    balance change = -$0.0550 - $0.0085  = -$0.0635
                     floored to            -$0.07
    rounding fee   = $0.07 - $0.0635    =  $0.0065
    ```

    **All fills:**

    | Fill | Trade Fee | Rounding | Accumulator |   Rebate |  Net Fee | Balance Change |
    | ---: | --------: | -------: | ----------: | -------: | -------: | -------------: |
    |    1 |  \$0.0085 | \$0.0065 |    \$0.0065 |        — | \$0.0150 |        -\$0.07 |
    |    2 |  \$0.0085 | \$0.0065 |    \$0.0130 | \$0.0100 | \$0.0050 |        -\$0.07 |
    |    3 |  \$0.0085 | \$0.0065 |    \$0.0095 |        — | \$0.0150 |        -\$0.07 |

    On Fill 2, the accumulator reaches \$0.0130 (> \$0.01), triggering a \$0.01 rebate. The net fee drops to \$0.0050 for that fill.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Fractional contracts: buy 0.90 contracts at $0.50 (three 0.30-lot matches)">
    Buy **0.90 contracts** at **\$0.50** — filled as three 0.30-lot matches. The price is a whole cent; rounding arises from the fractional quantity.

    **Fill 1 walkthrough:**

    ```
    revenue        = -$0.50 x 0.30       = -$0.1500
    trade fee      = $0.0041               (ceiled to centicent)
    balance change = -$0.1500 - $0.0041    = -$0.1541
                     floored to              -$0.16
    rounding fee   = $0.16 - $0.1541      =  $0.0059
    ```

    **All fills:**

    | Fill | Trade Fee | Rounding | Accumulator |   Rebate |  Net Fee | Balance Change |
    | ---: | --------: | -------: | ----------: | -------: | -------: | -------------: |
    |    1 |  \$0.0041 | \$0.0059 |    \$0.0059 |        — | \$0.0100 |        -\$0.16 |
    |    2 |  \$0.0041 | \$0.0059 |    \$0.0118 | \$0.0100 | \$0.0000 |        -\$0.16 |
    |    3 |  \$0.0041 | \$0.0059 |    \$0.0077 |        — | \$0.0100 |        -\$0.16 |

    On Fill 2, the accumulator reaches \$0.0118 (> \$0.01), triggering a \$0.01 rebate. The entire fee is offset, resulting in a \$0.00 net fee for that fill.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Combined: fractional contracts + subpenny prices (three 0.03-lot matches)">
    Buy **0.09 contracts** at **\$0.3301** — filled as three 0.03-lot matches. Both features contribute sub-cent components, pushing intermediates to 6 decimal places.

    **Fill 1 walkthrough:**

    ```
    revenue        = -$0.3301 x 0.03      = -$0.009903
    trade fee      = $0.0005                (ceiled to centicent)
    balance change = -$0.009903 - $0.0005  = -$0.010403
                     floored to              -$0.02
    rounding fee   = $0.02 - $0.010403     =  $0.009597
    ```

    **All fills:**

    | Fill | Trade Fee |   Rounding | Accumulator |   Rebate |    Net Fee | Balance Change |
    | ---: | --------: | ---------: | ----------: | -------: | ---------: | -------------: |
    |    1 |  \$0.0005 | \$0.009597 |  \$0.009597 |        — | \$0.010097 |        -\$0.02 |
    |    2 |  \$0.0005 | \$0.009597 |  \$0.019194 | \$0.0100 | \$0.000097 |        -\$0.02 |
    |    3 |  \$0.0005 | \$0.009597 |  \$0.018791 | \$0.0100 | \$0.000097 |        -\$0.02 |

    The accumulator triggers a rebate on both Fill 2 and Fill 3, keeping the total net fee close to the single-fill equivalent.

    <Note>
      Subpenny prices alone produce 4-decimal-place intermediates. Fractional contracts alone also produce 4-decimal-place intermediates. When combined, intermediates can reach 6 decimal places (e.g., \$0.3301 x 0.03 = \$0.009903). Final balances are always rounded to whole cents.
