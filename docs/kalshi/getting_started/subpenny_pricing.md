# Subpenny Pricing

> Understanding Kalshi subpenny pricing.

## Format

```
{
    "price": 12,              // legacy: cents
    "price_dollars": "0.1200" // new: fixed-point dollars
}
```

Starting soon in the API, you will begin to see prices and money represented in 2 different formats: integer cents (legacy) and fixed-point dollars (new).
A fixed-point dollar is a string bearing a fixed-point representation of money accurate to at least 4 decimal points.

## Motivation

Subpenny pricing will allow for more accurate pricing and the tail end of markets where likelihood of a given event are close to 100% or 0%.

## Status

Currently the minimum tick size on all markets is still 1 cent.
Additionally, all prices and money fields will continue to be available in the legacy integer cents format.

However, in the near future we will be introducing sub-penny pricing on orders. As such, we will eventually the legacy integer cents format.
Therefore, please update systems to parse the new fixed-point dollars fields and prepare for subpenny precision.
