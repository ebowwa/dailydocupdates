# Rate Limits and Tiers

> Understanding API rate limits, token costs, and access tiers

## Token-based limits

Every authenticated request costs **tokens**. Your tier defines how many tokens you can spend per second. Most requests cost the default of **10 tokens**; each operation's API reference page lists its cost where it differs (order cancellations, single-order reads, quote create/cancel, and multivariate-collection lookup are currently cheaper than the default).

Your effective rate for any given endpoint is `budget ÷ cost`.

## Reads and writes are billed separately

You have two independent token budgets:

| Bucket    | What it covers                                                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Read**  | `GET` endpoints and anything not explicitly routed elsewhere.           |
| **Write** | Order placement, amends, cancels, order groups, and the RFQ quote flow. |

## Perps limits use separate buckets

The Perps API uses the **same tiers and per-second token budgets** described here, but perps traffic is metered in its **own** Read and Write buckets. Perps calls don't draw down your event-contract budgets, and event-contract calls don't draw down your perps budgets. In effect you have up to four independent buckets: event-contract Read, event-contract Write, perps Read, and perps Write.

Check your perps tier and limits with [`GET /account/limits/perps`](/api-reference/account/get-perps-account-api-limits), the perps counterpart of [`GET /account/limits`](/api-reference/account/get-account-api-limits).

See the [Perps API](/margin) overview for the full perps surface.

## Batch endpoints don't save tokens

A batch request costs the same as making each call individually. Every item in the batch is billed separately:

* [Batch Create Orders](/api-reference/orders/batch-create-orders): submitting 25 orders costs `25 × 10 = 250` tokens.
* [Batch Cancel Orders](/api-reference/orders/batch-cancel-orders): cancelling 25 orders costs `25 × 2 = 50` tokens.

## Tiers and budgets

Per-second token budgets in each bucket:

## Tier qualification

* **Basic**: complete account signup.
* **Advanced**: complete the [Advanced API application](https://kalshi.typeform.com/advanced-api).
* **Premier, Paragon, and Prime**: earned automatically from your trading volume (see [Earning higher tiers](#earning-higher-tiers-by-volume) below), or assigned by Kalshi.

<Info>
  Kalshi may, at its discretion, adjust your tier at any time, including downgrading you from higher tiers following prolonged inactivity. Members may request an upgrade by contacting support with a description of their use case.
</Info>

## Earning higher tiers by volume

Once a day, Kalshi reviews your trading volume and grants Premier, Paragon, or Prime if you qualify. Your **volume share** is your trailing 30-day volume (counting both sides of every trade you're part of, as maker and as taker) divided by twice the previous calendar month's total exchange volume:

`volume share = your trailing 30-day volume ÷ (previous month's exchange volume × 2)`

Qualifying grants the tier for **30 days**, so a slow day never drops you right away. The daily review renews that window for as long as you keep qualifying, and each tier has two thresholds (a higher bar to **earn** it and a lower **Keep** bar to hold it), so a small dip doesn't cost you the tier:

| Tier    | Earn  | Keep  |
| ------- | ----- | ----- |
| Premier | 0.25% | 0.20% |
| Paragon | 0.50% | 0.40% |
| Prime   | 1.00% | 0.80% |

If your volume falls below the **Keep** bar, the tier doesn't drop immediately. It lapses only when your current 30-day grant runs out.

## Your grants

Your tier is the highest level among your active **grants**. Each grant raises you to a level on a lane, `event_contract` (predictions) or `margined` (margin), until it expires, and records how you got it:

* **`volume`**: earned automatically from your trading volume.
* **`manual`**: assigned by Kalshi.

Fetch your grants from [`GET /account/limits`](/api-reference/account/get-account-api-limits), returned alongside your current `usage_tier`:

```json theme={null}
{
  "usage_tier": "premier",
  "read":  { "refill_rate": 1000, "bucket_capacity": 1000 },
  "write": { "refill_rate": 1000, "bucket_capacity": 2000 },
  "grants": [
    { "exchange_instance": "event_contract", "level": "premier", "expires_ts": 1751558400, "source": "volume" },
    { "exchange_instance": "event_contract", "level": "advanced", "source": "manual" }
  ]
}
```

A grant with no `expires_ts` is permanent. You keep your best grant at each level, so a longer-lived manual grant is never shortened by a volume grant. Similarly, if a manual grant is close to expiry but you're now qualifying for the tier by volume, your grant is extended to a fresh 30 days.

## When you hit the limit

A rate-limited request returns `429 Too Many Requests` with the body:

```json theme={null}
{"error": "too many requests"}
```

429 responses don't currently include `Retry-After` or `X-RateLimit-*` headers. Apply exponential backoff on 429 until your bucket refills.

## Bursting above your per-second budget

Your Write bucket holds **two seconds** of your per-second budget, so idle or below-steady traffic builds up headroom you can spend in a single burst. Useful for event-driven clients reacting quickly to market moves or price prints. Each request drains the bucket by its token cost; the bucket refills continuously at your per-second budget up to its capacity.

Over-drawing returns `429 Too Many Requests`. There's no enforced cooldown; your next request is allowed as soon as the bucket has enough tokens to cover it.

Basic tier is the exception: its Write bucket holds one second of budget, with no accumulated headroom.
