        Fixed-point contract count string (2 decimals, e.g., "10.00"; referred

        "10", "10.0", "10.00"); responses always emit 2 decimals. Fractional
        contract values (e.g., "2.50") are supported on markets with fractional
        trading enabled; the minimum granularity is 0.01 contracts. Integer
        contract count fields are legacy and will be deprecated; when both
        integer and fp fields are provided, they must match.
