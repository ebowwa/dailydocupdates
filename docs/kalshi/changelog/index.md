# API Changelog

> Stay updated with API changes and version history

You can subscribe to the RSS changelog at `/changelog/rss.xml` if you'd like to stay ahead of breaking changes.

You can reference the pending API spec under the "version" dropdown menu at the top left. When the actual API is upgraded to this new version, you will see the version marked as "Stable" in the drop-down menu and become the new default on the landing page.

This changelog is a work in progress. As always, we welcome any feedback in our Discord #dev channel!

## Recent Updates

<Update

  tags={["Change", "Upcoming"]}
  rss={{
title: "Legacy field deprecation on March 5 and fractional trading in demo",
description: "Legacy integer count and price fields will be deprecated on March 5, 2026. Fractional share trading is available for testing in demo.",
}}
>
  Fractional share trading is now available for testing in the demo environment on the following markets:

  * `KXUCL-26-ARS`
  * `KXUCL-26-AJA`

  Legacy fields will be deprecated on `March 5, 2026`:

  * Integer count fields with an `_fp` equivalent will no longer be returned. See [Fixed-Point Contracts](/getting_started/fixed_point_contracts) for migration details.
  * Integer cents price fields (e.g., `yes_bid`, `no_ask`, `last_price`) will no longer be returned. Their `_dollars` equivalents are already available. See [Subpenny Pricing](/getting_started/subpenny_pricing) for details.

  More information will be forthcoming on how fee rounding works with fractional contracts.

  tags={["New Feature", "Upcoming"]}
  rss={{
title: "Historical data endpoints and cutoff timestamps",
description: "New endpoints for retrieving historical exchange data and cutoff timestamps defining the live/historical boundary"
}}
>
  Kalshi now partitions exchange data into **live** and **historical** tiers. Historical data must be accessed via the new historical API endpoints. The `GET /historical/cutoff` endpoint returns the cutoff timestamps that define this boundary.

  **Cutoff timestamps and what they mean:**

  * `market_settled_ts` — partitioned by **market settlement time**. Markets and their candlesticks that settled before this timestamp are only available via `GET /historical/markets` and `GET /historical/markets/{ticker}/candlesticks`.
  * `trades_created_ts` — partitioned by **trade fill time**. Fills that occurred before this timestamp are only available via `GET /historical/fills`.
  * `orders_updated_ts` — partitioned by **order cancellation or execution time**. Orders canceled or fully executed before this timestamp are only available via `GET /historical/orders`. **Resting (active) orders are unaffected** and always appear in `GET /portfolio/orders`.

  **New endpoints:**

  * `GET /historical/cutoff` — returns the market, trade, and order cutoff timestamps
  * `GET /historical/markets` — settled markets older than the cutoff
  * `GET /historical/markets/{ticker}` — single historical market by ticker
  * `GET /historical/markets/{ticker}/candlesticks` — candlestick data for historical markets
  * `GET /historical/fills` — trade fills older than the cutoff
  * `GET /historical/orders` — canceled/executed orders older than the cutoff

  **Impacted live endpoints:**

  * `GET /markets`, `GET /markets/{ticker}` — settled markets older than `market_settled_ts` will not appear
  * `GET /events` with `with_nested_markets=true` — nested markets older than `market_settled_ts` will not be included
  * `GET /series/{series_ticker}/markets/{ticker}/candlesticks`, `GET /markets/candlesticks` — candlestick data is tied to the market; historical markets' candlesticks must be fetched from `GET /historical/markets/{ticker}/candlesticks`
  * `GET /markets/trades`, `GET /portfolio/fills` — fills older than `trades_created_ts` will not appear
  * `GET /portfolio/orders` — completed/canceled orders older than `orders_updated_ts` will not appear (resting orders are unaffected)

  **Behavior changes:**

  * You can now amend orders without providing `client_order_id` fields by using only the `order_id` from the URL path

    "action": "buy",

  1. **Past expiration timestamps now rejected**: Orders with `expiration_ts` in the past will be rejected with error "Expiration timestamp must be in the future" instead of being automatically converted to IoC orders.

  2. **IoC + expiration\_ts combination rejected**: Orders cannot specify both `time_in_force: "immediate_or_cancel"` and `expiration_ts`. This will be rejected at the API level with error "Cannot specify both immediate\_or\_cancel and expiration\_ts".

  3. **IoC orders no longer support expiration**: The IoC order type is now independent and does not accept an expiration timestamp.

  **Migration guide**: If you were previously using past `expiration_ts` values to indicate IoC behavior, you must now explicitly set `time_in_force: "immediate_or_cancel"` instead.

  Fixed the `GET /series` endpoint's tags parameter to properly support tags containing spaces. Previously, the parameter would split on both commas AND spaces, breaking searches for tags like "Rotten Tomatoes".

  GET /series?tags=Rotten Tomatoes

  // Result: No matches found

  **After (fixed):**

  ```
  GET /series?tags=Rotten Tomatoes

  GET /series?tags=Rotten Tomatoes,Television

  rss={{
title: "Exposing read-only subpenny pricing",
description: "Exposing read-only subpenny pricing in the API."
}}
>
  Subpenny pricing fields have been added to APIs involving price, fees, and money in general.
  E.g. next to a field called `"price": 12` (representing 12 cents), you will also see `"price_dollars": "0.1200"`,
  which is a string bearing a fixed-point representation of money accuate to at 4 decimal points.

  For now, this change is read-only, meaning that the minimum allowable tick size for orders is still 1c. Eventually,
  we will introduce sub-penny pricing on orders. For now, please prepare for an eventual migration to the higher granularity
  price representation.

  For more info, see [Subpenny Pricing](/getting_started/subpenny_pricing).
