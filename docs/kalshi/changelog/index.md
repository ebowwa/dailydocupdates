# API Changelog

> Stay updated with API changes and version history

You can subscribe to the RSS changelog at `/changelog/rss.xml` if you'd like to stay ahead of breaking changes.

This changelog is a work in progress. As always, we welcome any feedback in our Discord #dev channel!

This changelog covers Kalshi's REST, WebSocket, and FIX APIs across both the
Predictions and Margin exchanges. Use the entry tags to filter by API
surface (`REST`, `WebSocket`, `FIX`) or exchange (`Predictions`, `Margin`).
FIX API changes, previously tracked on a separate page, now live here under
the `FIX` tag.

  `GET /trade-api/v2/communications/quotes/{quote_id}` will cost 2 tokens per
  request, matching the non-default cost for quote create and delete.

  **Affected endpoints:**

  * `GET /trade-api/v2/communications/quotes/{quote_id}`
</Update>

  `GET /trade-api/v2/communications/quotes` no longer supports filtering by
  `market_ticker` or `event_ticker`, effective immediately. Requests should
  filter quotes by user, RFQ, status, or update time instead.

  The events API now returns `settlement_sources` on each event, mirroring the
  field already available on series. Each entry has a `name` and `url`
  identifying an official source used to determine the event's markets.

title: "Strike type and cap strike on market_lifecycle_v2 metadata_updated",
description: "metadata_updated events on the market_lifecycle_v2 channel now include strike_type and cap_strike alongside floor_strike."
}}
>
  `metadata_updated` events on the `market_lifecycle_v2` channel now include
  `strike_type` and `cap_strike` (plus `custom_strike` for custom/structured
  markets) alongside `floor_strike`. Consumers can reconstruct a market's full
  strike range directly from the push — e.g. a `between` band needs both floor
  and cap, and `less` markets are cap-only — without a follow-up fetch against
  the eventually-consistent read model.

  `metadata_updated` is now also emitted when a market's `cap_strike` or
  `strike_type` changes; previously only `floor_strike` and `yes_sub_title`
  changes triggered it.

  In certain uncommon cases, responses from `DELETE /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders/{order_id}` and `POST /trade-api/v2/portfolio/events/orders/{order_id}/amend` do not describe the order that was cancelled or amended — the `order_id`, `client_order_id`, and quantity fields (`reduced_by_centicount`, `remaining_centicount`, fill fields) in the response may not correspond to your request. The cancel or amend itself executes correctly against the intended order; only the response body is affected. Downstream order and position state are correct.

  As a result, the previously announced rate-limit cost bump on the legacy `/portfolio/orders*` endpoints is delayed until May 21.

    * With Logon flag `21027=Y`, Execution Reports with `ExecType=Trade` include two new tags:
      * `SingleMarketCollateralReturn` (21030): collateral freed from reducing/closing a position in a single market
      * `RangedMarketCollateralReturn` (21031): collateral freed from MECNET/DIRECNET netting across a market group
    * Both values are in dollars and only present when non-zero
    * These are informational subsets of the existing BALANCE collateral change — they describe components within the total balance delta
    * Without `21027`, Execution Reports remain unchanged (existing behavior)

  happens, subscribe to a smaller subset of data, or ensure that your connection
  read throughput is optimized.

}}
>
  Order, Fill, and Trade responses now include two new normalized direction
  fields. Each carries the full directional bit on its own — combining
  `action` with `side` is no longer required to know what the user is
  positioned for. The two fields encode the same bit in two vocabularies:
  `bid` is equivalent to `yes`, `ask` is equivalent to `no`.

  * `outcome_side` (`yes` | `no`) — the outcome the user profits from.
    Buy-yes and sell-no produce `yes`; buy-no and sell-yes produce `no`.
  * `book_side` (`bid` | `ask`) — same bit in book vocabulary.

  Affected REST responses (`svc-api2`):

  * `Order` (GetOrders, GetOrder, GetHistoricalOrders, and order-write responses)
  * `Fill` (GetFills, GetFillsHistorical)
  * `Trade` (public) — fields are named `taker_outcome_side` and `taker_book_side` to match the existing `taker_side`

  Affected WebSocket channels (`svc-apiexternal-ws`):

  * `user_orders`
  * `fill`
  * `trade` — `taker_outcome_side` and `taker_book_side`

  `outcome_side` describes directional exposure only; it does not change
  the order's price. An order at price `p` with `outcome_side=no` is
  matched by an order at the same price `p` with `outcome_side=yes` —
  both parties trade at the same price, just on opposite directions.

  Existing `action`, `side`, `is_yes`, `purchased_side`, and `taker_side`
  fields are now marked deprecated. `outcome_side` and `book_side` are
  the canonical way to determine order/trade direction going forward.
  The legacy fields **will not be removed before May 28, 2026** — please
  migrate to the new fields when integrating against these endpoints.

  See the [Order direction](/getting_started/order_direction) reference
  page for the full migration table and equivalence rules.

  **Cutoff timestamps and what they mean:**

  * `market_settled_ts` — partitioned by **market settlement time**. Markets and their candlesticks that settled before this timestamp are only available via `GET /historical/markets` and `GET /historical/markets/{ticker}/candlesticks`.

  * `GET /historical/cutoff` — returns the market, trade, and order cutoff timestamps
  * `GET /historical/markets` — settled markets older than the cutoff
  * `GET /historical/markets/{ticker}` — single historical market by ticker
  * `GET /historical/markets/{ticker}/candlesticks` — candlestick data for historical markets
  * `GET /historical/fills` — trade fills older than the cutoff

  The `client_order_id` and `updated_client_order_id` fields in amend order requests are now optional.

  **Behavior changes:**

  * You can now amend orders without providing `client_order_id` fields by using only the `order_id` from the URL path
  * If you provide an `updated_client_order_id`, the order can be found by the exchange and the `client_order_id` updated just on `order_id` alone

  **Affected endpoint:**

  **Example:**

  ```json theme={null}
  {
    "ticker": "MARKET-TICKER",
    "side": "yes",
    "action": "buy",
    "count_fp": "50.00",

  Added sharding support to the `communications` WebSocket channel for high-throughput RFQ/quote consumers.

  **New subscription parameters:**

  * `shard_factor` (int): Number of shards to divide messages across (e.g., 4)
  * `shard_key` (int): Which shard this connection receives (0 to shard\_factor-1)

  Messages are sharded by `market_ticker` using consistent hashing. Clients can run multiple connections with different `shard_key` values to distribute load while ensuring complete coverage.

  **Validation:**

  * `shard_factor` must be > 0 when provided
  * `shard_key` must be >= 0 and \< `shard_factor`
  * `shard_key` requires `shard_factor` to be set

  **Example subscription:**

  ```json theme={null}
  {
    "id": 1,
    "cmd": "subscribe",
    "params": {
      "channels": ["communications"],
      "shard_factor": 4,

  1. **Past expiration timestamps now rejected**: Orders with `expiration_ts` in the past will be rejected with error "Expiration timestamp must be in the future" instead of being automatically converted to IoC orders.

  2. **IoC + expiration\_ts combination rejected**: Orders cannot specify both `time_in_force: "immediate_or_cancel"` and `expiration_ts`. This will be rejected at the API level with error "Cannot specify both immediate\_or\_cancel and expiration\_ts".

  3. **IoC orders no longer support expiration**: The IoC order type is now independent and does not accept an expiration timestamp.

  **Migration guide**: If you were previously using past `expiration_ts` values to indicate IoC behavior, you must now explicitly set `time_in_force: "immediate_or_cancel"` instead.

  Added comprehensive support for multivariate events (combos) with new API endpoints and enhanced filtering:

  **New Endpoint and deprecation of multivariate events in GetEvents endpoint**

  * `GET /events/multivariate` - Retrieve multivariate events with filtering by series and collection ticker.
  * `GET /events` will EXCLUDE multivariate events upon the next release (November 13th). Please use the new endpoint!

  **Enhanced Market Filtering:**

  * `GET /markets` now supports `mve_filter` parameter:
    * `"only"` - Returns only multivariate events
    * `"exclude"` - Excludes multivariate events
    * No parameter - Returns all events (default behavior)

  Expected release: `November 6th, 2025`

  * Error code: `"invalid order"`
  * Error details: `"post only cross"`

  Fixed the `GET /series` endpoint's tags parameter to properly support tags containing spaces. Previously, the parameter would split on both commas AND spaces, breaking searches for tags like "Rotten Tomatoes".

  **Breaking Change:**

  * The `tags` query parameter now **only** splits on commas (`,`), not spaces
  * Tags with spaces (e.g., "Rotten Tomatoes") now work correctly
  * Multiple tags must be comma-separated: `?tags=Rotten Tomatoes,Television`

  **Before (broken):**

  ```
  GET /series?tags=Rotten Tomatoes
  // Was incorrectly parsed as: ["Rotten", "Tomatoes"]
  // Result: No matches found
  ```

  **After (fixed):**

  ```
  GET /series?tags=Rotten Tomatoes
  // Correctly parsed as: ["Rotten Tomatoes"]
  // Result: Returns series with the "Rotten Tomatoes" tag

  GET /series?tags=Rotten Tomatoes,Television
  // Correctly parsed as: ["Rotten Tomatoes", "Television"]
  // Result: Returns series with either tag
  ```

  This change may affect integrations that relied on space-separated tags. Please update to use comma-separated tags only.

  * `GET /multivariate_event_collections`

  For optimization purposes, partial fills generated by self-crossing FoK orders are not rolled back.
  If a FoK order self-crosses, order execution proceeds based on `self_trade_prevention_type`:

  * `taker_at_cross`: the taker is canceled, execution stops. Any partial fills are executed.
  * `maker`: the maker is canceled, execution continues. After execution, remaining taker quantity is canceled.
