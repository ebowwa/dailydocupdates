# WebSocket Connection

> Main WebSocket connection endpoint. All communication happens through this single connection.
Authentication is required to establish the connection; include API key headers during the WebSocket handshake.
Some channels carry only public market data, but the connection itself still requires authentication.
Use the subscribe command to subscribe to specific data channels. For more information, see the [Getting Started](https://docs.kalshi.com/getting_started/quick_start_websockets) guide.
