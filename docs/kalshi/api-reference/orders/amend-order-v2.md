# Amend Order (V2)

> Endpoint for amending the price and/or max fillable count of an existing event-market order using the V2 request/response shape. The request `count` is the updated total/max fillable count, equal to already filled count plus desired resting remaining count. This behavior matches the v1 amend endpoints; only the request/response shape differs.

        Side of the book for an order or trade. For event markets, this refers
        to the YES leg only: `bid` means buy YES, `ask` means sell YES. (Selling
        YES is economically equivalent to buying NO at `1 - price`, but this
        endpoint quotes everything from the YES side.)
    FixedPointDollars:
      type: string
      description: >-
        US dollar amount as a fixed-point decimal string with up to 6 decimal
        places of precision. This is the maximum supported precision; valid
        quote intervals for a given market are constrained by that market's
        price level structure.
      example: '0.5600'
    FixedPointCount:
      type: string
      description: >-
        Fixed-point contract count string (2 decimals, e.g., "10.00"; referred
        to as "fp" in field names). Requests accept 0–2 decimal places (e.g.,
        "10", "10.0", "10.00"); responses always emit 2 decimals. Fractional
        contract values (e.g., "2.50") are supported on markets with fractional
        trading enabled; the minimum granularity is 0.01 contracts. Integer
        contract count fields are legacy and will be deprecated; when both
        integer and fp fields are provided, they must match.
      example: '10.00'
    ExchangeIndex:
      type: integer
      description: >-
        Identifier for an exchange shard. Defaults to 0 if unspecified. Note:
        currently only 0 supported.
