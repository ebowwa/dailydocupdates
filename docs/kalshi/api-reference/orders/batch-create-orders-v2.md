# Batch Create Orders (V2)

> Endpoint for submitting a batch of event-market orders using the V2 request/response shape. The maximum batch size scales with your tier's write budget — see [Rate Limits and Tiers](/getting_started/rate_limits).

<Note>
  **Rate limit:** 10 tokens per order in the batch — billed per item, so total cost for a batch of N orders is N × 10. Other endpoints cost 10 tokens per request (not per item) unless noted on their own page. See [Rate Limits and Tiers](/getting_started/rate_limits).

        Fixed-point contract count string (2 decimals, e.g., "10.00"; referred
        to as "fp" in field names). Requests accept 0–2 decimal places (e.g.,
        "10", "10.0", "10.00"); responses always emit 2 decimals. Fractional
        contract values (e.g., "2.50") are supported on markets with fractional
        trading enabled; the minimum granularity is 0.01 contracts. Integer
        contract count fields are legacy and will be deprecated; when both
        integer and fp fields are provided, they must match.
      example: '10.00'
