# Transfer Position Between Subaccounts

> Moves an existing position between two of the authenticated user's own subaccounts. Use 0 for the primary account, or 1-63 for numbered subaccounts. The transfer is idempotent on `client_transfer_id`: retrying with the same value returns 409. `price` is the per-contract transfer price as a fixed-point dollar string, and is always the YES-side price regardless of `side` — see the [Subaccounts](/getting_started/subaccounts) page for how it sets cost basis and P&L.

      summary: Transfer Position Between Subaccounts
      description: >-
        Moves an existing position between two of the authenticated user's own
        subaccounts. Use 0 for the primary account, or 1-63 for numbered
        subaccounts. The transfer is idempotent on `client_transfer_id`:
        retrying with the same value returns 409. `price` is the per-contract
        transfer price as a fixed-point dollar string, and is always the
        YES-side price regardless of `side` — see the
        [Subaccounts](/getting_started/subaccounts) page for how it sets cost
        basis and P&L.
