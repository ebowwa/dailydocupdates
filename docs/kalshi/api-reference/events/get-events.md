        US dollar amount as a fixed-point decimal string with up to 4 decimal

        Fixed-point contract count string (2 decimals, e.g., "10.00"; referred

        "10", "10.0", "10.00"); responses always emit 2 decimals. Currently only
        whole contract values are permitted, but the format supports future
        fractional precision. Integer contract count fields are legacy and will
        be deprecated; when both integer and fp fields are provided, they must
        match.
      example: '10.00'
