    FixedPointCount:

      description: >-
        Fixed-point contract count string (2 decimals, e.g., "10.00"; referred
        to as "fp" in field names). Requests accept 0–2 decimal places (e.g.,
        "10", "10.0", "10.00"); responses always emit 2 decimals. Currently only
        whole contract values are permitted, but the format supports future
        fractional precision. Integer contract count fields are legacy and will
        be deprecated; when both integer and fp fields are provided, they must
        match.
      example: '10.00'
    FixedPointDollars:
      type: string
      description: >-
        US dollar amount as a fixed-point decimal string with up to 4 decimal
        places of precision. This is the maximum supported precision; valid
        quote intervals for a given market are constrained by that market's
        price level structure.
      example: '0.5600'
