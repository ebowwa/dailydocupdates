# Split Tokens

> Convert USDC.e into outcome token pairs

**Splitting** converts USDC.e collateral into a full (position) set of outcome tokens. For every \$1 USDC.e you split, you receive 1 Yes token and 1 No token.

```
$100 USDC.e → 100 Yes tokens + 100 No tokens
```

## Prerequisites

Before splitting, ensure you have:

1. **USDC.e balance** on Polygon
2. **USDC.e approval** for the CTF contract to spend your tokens
3. **Condition ID** of the market — the condition must already be prepared on the CTF contract (via `prepareCondition`)

<Note>
  If the partition is trivial, invalid, or refers to more slots than the
  condition is prepared with, the transaction will revert.
</Note>

## How It Works

1. You approve the CTF contract to spend your USDC.e
2. You call `splitPosition()` with the amount and market details
3. The CTF contract transfers USDC.e from your wallet and mints both outcome tokens

The operation is atomic — if any step fails, the entire transaction reverts.
