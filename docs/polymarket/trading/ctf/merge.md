# Merge Tokens

> Convert outcome token pairs back to USDC.e

**Merging** is the inverse of splitting — it converts a full set of outcome tokens back into USDC.e collateral. For every 1 Yes token and 1 No token you merge, you receive \$1 USDC.e. The condition must already be prepared on the CTF contract (via `prepareCondition`).

```
100 Yes tokens + 100 No tokens → $100 USDC.e
```

## Prerequisites

Before merging, you need:

1. **Equal amounts** of both Yes and No tokens
2. **Condition ID** of the market
3. **Sufficient gas** for the transaction

## How It Works

1. You call `mergePositions()` with the amount and market details
2. One unit of each position in a full set is burned in return for 1 collateral unit
3. The CTF contract releases USDC.e back to your wallet

The operation is atomic — if you don't have enough of both tokens, the transaction reverts.
