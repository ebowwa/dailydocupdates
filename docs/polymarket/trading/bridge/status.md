# Deposit Status

> Track the progress of your bridge deposits

After sending assets to your deposit address, use the status endpoint to track progress until funds arrive in your Polymarket wallet.

## Check Status

Query the status of all deposits to a specific deposit address.

```bash  theme={null}
curl https://bridge.polymarket.com/status/0x23566f8b2E82aDfCf01846E54899d110e97AC053
```

<Note>
  Use the deposit address from the `/deposit` response (EVM, SVM, or BTC), not
  your Polymarket wallet address.
</Note>

## Transaction Statuses

Each deposit progresses through these statuses:

| Status                | Terminal | Description                                        |

| `PROCESSING`          | No       | Transaction is being routed and swapped            |
| `ORIGIN_TX_CONFIRMED` | No       | Source chain transaction confirmed                 |
| `SUBMITTED`           | No       | Submitted to destination chain (Polygon)           |
| `COMPLETED`           | Yes      | Funds arrived — transaction successful             |
| `FAILED`              | Yes      | Transaction encountered an error                   |

## Empty Response

An empty `transactions` array means no deposits have been detected at this address yet:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "transactions": []
}
```

<Tip>
  Transactions typically complete within a few minutes, but may take longer
  depending on network conditions. Poll every 10-30 seconds until `COMPLETED` or
  `FAILED`.
