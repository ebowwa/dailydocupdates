# Deposit

> Bridge assets from any supported chain to fund your Polymarket account

Polymarket uses **USDC.e** (Bridged USDC) on Polygon as collateral for all trading. The Bridge API lets you deposit assets from Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, and other chains—they're automatically converted to USDC.e on Polygon.

## How It Works

1. Request deposit addresses for your Polymarket wallet
2. Send assets to the appropriate address for your source chain
3. Assets are bridged and swapped to USDC.e automatically
4. USDC.e is credited to your wallet for trading

## Create Deposit Addresses

Generate unique deposit addresses linked to your Polymarket wallet. See the [Bridge API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for full request and response schemas.

```bash  theme={null}
curl -X POST https://bridge.polymarket.com/deposit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address": "0x56687bf447db6ffa42ffe2204a05edaa20f55839"}'
```

### Address Types

| Address | Use For                                                  |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `evm`   | Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, and other EVM chains |
| `svm`   | Solana                                                   |
| `btc`   | Bitcoin                                                  |
| `tvm`   | Tron                                                     |

<Warning>
  Each address is unique to your wallet. Only send assets from supported chains
  to the correct address type.
</Warning>

## Deposit Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your Deposit Address">
    Call `POST /deposit` with your Polymarket wallet address to get deposit
    addresses.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Supported Assets">
    Verify your token is supported and meets the minimum deposit amount via
    `/supported-assets`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Assets">
    Transfer tokens to the appropriate deposit address from your source chain.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track Status">
    Monitor your deposit progress using `/status/{address}`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## USDC vs USDC.e

You can deposit either USDC (native) or USDC.e (bridged) to your Polymarket wallet. If you deposit native USDC, you will be prompted to "activate funds," which swaps it to USDC.e via the lowest-fee Uniswap pool (less than 10bp slippage).

## Large Deposits

For deposits over \$50,000 originating from a chain other than Polygon, we recommend using a third-party bridge to minimize slippage:

* [DeBridge](https://app.debridge.finance/)
* [Across](https://app.across.to/bridge)
* [Portal](https://portalbridge.com/)

Bridge directly to your Polymarket USDC (Polygon) deposit address. Polymarket is not affiliated with or responsible for any third-party bridge.

## Minimum Deposits

Each asset has a minimum deposit amount. Deposits below the minimum will not be processed. Check `/supported-assets` for current minimums.

## Deposit Recovery

If you deposited the wrong token on Ethereum or Polygon, use these tools to recover your funds:

* **Ethereum deposits**: [recovery.polymarket.com](https://recovery.polymarket.com/)
* **Polygon deposits**: [matic-recovery.polymarket.com](https://matic-recovery.polymarket.com/)

<Warning>
  Sending unsupported tokens may cause **irrecoverable loss**. Always verify
  your token is listed in [Supported Assets](/trading/bridge/supported-assets)
  before depositing.
