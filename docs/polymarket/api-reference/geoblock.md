# Geographic Restrictions

> Check geographic restrictions before placing orders on the Polymarket API

Polymarket restricts order placement from certain geographic locations due to regulatory requirements and compliance with international sanctions. Before placing orders, builders should verify the location.

<Warning>
  Orders submitted from blocked regions will be rejected. Implement geoblock
  checks in your application to provide users with appropriate feedback before
  they attempt to trade.
</Warning>

***

## Geoblock Endpoint

Check the geographic eligibility of the requesting IP address:

```bash  theme={null}
GET https://polymarket.com/api/geoblock
```

<Note>This endpoint is on `polymarket.com`, not the API servers.</Note>

### Response

```json  theme={null}
{
  "blocked": true,
  "ip": "203.0.113.42",
  "country": "US",
  "region": "NY"
}
```

| Field     | Type    | Description                                     |

| `blocked` | boolean | Whether the user is blocked from placing orders |
| `ip`      | string  | Detected IP address                             |

## Blocked Regions

In addition to fully blocked countries, the following specific regions within otherwise accessible countries are also restricted:

| Country      | Region  | Region Code |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------- |
| Canada (CA)  | Ontario | ON          |
| Ukraine (UA) | Crimea  | 43          |
| Ukraine (UA) | Donetsk | 14          |
| Ukraine (UA) | Luhansk | 09          |

## Blocking Logic

The geoblocking system includes:

1. **OFAC-Sanctioned Countries**: Countries sanctioned by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
2. **Additional Regulatory Restrictions**: Countries added for specific regulatory compliance reasons

***

## Server Infrastructure

* **Primary Servers**: eu-west-2
* **Closest Non-Georestricted Region**: eu-west-1
