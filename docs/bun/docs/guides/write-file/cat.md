# Write a file to stdout

Bun exposes `stdout` as a `BunFile` with the `Bun.stdout` property. This can be used as a destination for [`Bun.write()`](/runtime/file-io#writing-files-bun-write).

This code writes a file to `stdout` similar to the `cat` command in Unix.

```ts cat.ts icon="https://mintcdn.com/bun-1dd33a4e/JUhaF6Mf68z_zHyy/icons/typescript.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=JUhaF6Mf68z_zHyy&q=85&s=7ac549adaea8d5487d8fbd58cc3ea35b" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
const path = "/path/to/file.txt";
const file = Bun.file(path);
await Bun.write(Bun.stdout, file);
```
